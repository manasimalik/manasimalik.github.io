## About Me

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Leyla Isik at the Department of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins University
â€‹
I am interested in understanding cognition and its underlying neural correlates using computational modeling and analysis methods. Primarily, my interests lie in understanding social cognition.

Prior to joining JHU, I worked at TCS Innovation Labs to develop deep learning models to improve advertising effectiveness. I did my B.Tech from IIIT Delhi in Electronics and Communication with a minor in Computational Biology. For my Bachelors' thesis, I worked on Multi-sensory Perception at the National Brain Research Center, India
